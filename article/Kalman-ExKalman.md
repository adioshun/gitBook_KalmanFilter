## 1. The Basic Kalman Filter — using Lidar Data

The Kalman filter is over 50 years old, but is still one of the most powerful sensor fusion algorithms for smoothing noisy input data and estimating state. 

It assumes that location variables are gaussian i.e. can be completely parametrized by the mean and the covariance




## 2. The Extended Kalman filter — using Radar Data
